# Vortex Map Bot

Called on twitter from account @vortexmapbot

Breaks down strings to do vortex math calculation to find their votrex number and create a vortex map. This will just end up being a graph of
a mathematical caustic with cardoid properties. For the letters we find its numerical equivilant and then find its digital root. Each
word of a a tweet's letters are calcuated and then graphed on a 9 point circle

## What is vortex math?

A pseudoscientific mathematics based philosophy that professes that finding a digital root to letters and other numbers, we can see "the secrets" of the universe and its' fundmental math.

"Vortex math is a system of numbers which explains the essence of form as a sphere with a vortex..."

"Vortex-based math is a pseudomathematical/vaguely theological pile of nonsense for which some guy named Marko Rodin is to blame. On his website he claims it's the secret to unlocking the Universe or some such."

## Why this bot?

I am using the vortex math to see what type of art can be created find the digital roots of words in tweets we see daily. This is an art project to dive into this "spiritial math"
