# Vortex Map Bot

Called on twitter from account @vortexmapbot

Breaks down strings to do vortex math calculation to find their votrex number and create a vortex map. This will just end up being a graph of
a mathematical caustic with cardoid properties. For the letters we find its numerical equivilant and then find its digital root. Each
word of a a tweet's letters are calcuated and then graphed on a 9 point circle
