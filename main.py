Tesla Number Bot

[If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6 and 9, then you would have the key to the universe. - Nikola Tesla]

Breaks down strings to do vortex diagrams and math calculation to find their votrex number. This will just end up being a graph of
a mathematical caustic with cardoid properties. For the letters we find its numerical equivilant and then find its digital root. Each
word of a a tweet's letters are calcuated and then graphed on a circle with int point 

A cardioid is a two-dimensional plane figure that has a heart-shaped curve.
A caustic is the envelope of rays either reflected or refracted by a manifold

Digital Root - Add up the digital of a number until its a single digit
